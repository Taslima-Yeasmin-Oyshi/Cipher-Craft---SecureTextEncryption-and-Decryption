# Cipher Craft - Secure Text Encryption and Decryption
 The "Cipher Craft" project aims to develop a C++ program that provides a secure method for encrypting and decrypting text. The program utilizes a custom algorithm, different from the Caesar Cipher, to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data. This report presents a detailed analysis of the project, including the problem statement, target audience, motivation, and review of existing projects, workable solutions, and tools used, methodology, timeframe, features, screenshots, limitations, future work, and conclusion.
                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                      
 The project will be a fully functional encryption/decryption program where When the user opens the
program, they will see a menu to choose the encryption method: Caser cipher which is text to text
encryption or custom algorithm, which is text to number. They will enter the text to encrypt or decrypt,
and the program will validate the input.
For the Caesar cipher method, the user enters their text and a key value to shift each letter by. For
example, if the user enters "HELLO WORLD" and chooses a key value of 3, the program will encrypt the
text to "KHOOR ZRUOG".
For the custom algorithm method, the program converts each letter to its corresponding number
value, such as H=23, A = 11, F=21 and E=15. If the user enters "HELLO" for this method, the program
will encrypt it to "23 15 32 32 35 ".

After applying the selected method, the program will show the result in a user-friendly interface, including
a drag and drop form. The program will handle errors and provide clear instructions for the user.
