# Cipher Craft - Secure Text Encryption and Decryption
 The "Cipher Craft" project aims to develop a C++ program that provides a secure method for encrypting and decrypting text. The program utilizes a custom algorithm, different from the Caesar Cipher, to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data. This report presents a detailed analysis of the project, including the problem statement, target audience, motivation, and review of existing projects, workable solutions, and tools used, methodology, timeframe, features, screenshots, limitations, future work, and conclusion.
